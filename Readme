This is my very first python project!

Overall, it is still a very basic use of the sentimental analysis and I am still exploring the uses and applications of it.

Special thanks to freecodecamp.org for their 1.5hr youtube hour to get me started on this project.
I then tweaked certain parts like a further breakdown of sentimental values, followed by showing some visualisation 
as of how the sentiments are like. 

Would appreciate constructive comments on how I can better improve it, in terms of more meaningful insights, 
or better written code:)
